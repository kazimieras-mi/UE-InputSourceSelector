# Unreal Engine Input Source Selector Plugin (C++)

Keeps track of the current input source used and allows any other system to ask what it is.

**Note:** This plugin shouldn't be used alone. It's only available as a dependency for my other work. Actually, this method of input switching has been deprecated by dynamic and contextual input mappings in Epic's Enhanced Input Plugin.

Made for Unreal Engine and permissively licensed. Hope you find it useful!
